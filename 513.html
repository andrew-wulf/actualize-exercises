<h1>How To Cook The Perfect Cinnamon Rolls</h1>

<p>Hello, readers! Today we're going to be learning how to make the perfect cinnamon rolls. Here's the ingredients you'll need:</p>

<h2>For the dough:</h2>
<ul>
    <li> 3/4 cup warm milk</li>
    <li> 1 packet instant or active yeast</li>
    <li> Cinnamon (2 gallons)</li>
    <li> flour</li>
    <li> 2 eggs</li>
    <li> 1/2 cup sugar</li>
    <li> 2 Tsp salt</li>
    <li> melted butter (2 sticks)</li>
</ul>

<h2>For the filling:</h2>
<ul>
    <li> 1/3 cup dark brown sugar</li>
    <li> 4 & 1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
    <li> 1/2 stick butter, softened</li>
</ul>

<h2>For the frosting:</h2>
<ul>
    <li> mayonnaise (jar)</li>
    <li> 3 tbs vanilla extract</li>
    <li> 1/4 cup cinnamon</li>
</ul>



<h1>Instructions</h1>


<h2>Step 1</h2>
<p>First things first, the dough! throw all the ingredients into a blender and set it to high. Once the blender grinds to a halt, you've got the perfect dough! </p>
<p>(It'll take a while to remove the dough from the blender, and you might want to have a backup blender in case the first one breaks.)</p>
<h2>Step 2</h2>
<p>Knead dough into a ball, then toss it into the oven at <b>250 degrees</b> for it to rise. Wait the full hour if you can, but if you're impatient,</p>
<p>turning the temperature up will decrease the time it takes to rise. (every 10 degrees = 10 minutes you don't have to wait!)</p>
<p><i>For extra credit: put the dough in a bowl first.</i></p>
<h2>Step 3</h2>
<p>Once the dough has risen, take it out of the oven and roll it out as much as you can. Get a nice spread, really work those forearms!</p>
<h2>Step 4</h2>
<p>Mix the cinnamon filling, and spread over the dough. Then, roll up the dough tightly and cut into rolls. Turn oven to <b>460 degrees</b> and set a timer for <b>20 minutes</b> (10 minutes at 500 works too). </p>
<h2>Step 5</h2>
<p>Time to work on the frosting! Knead ingredients thoroughly by hand until combined. If you don't have any mayonnaise, cream cheese works well as a substitute.</p>
<h2>Step 6</h2>
<p>Keep your nose tuned to the oven, as a smoky smell might emanate after a few minutes. Once that happens, or when the timer goes off, remove the rolls,</p>
<p>apply the frosting, and you're done! Let the rolls cool for a few minutes before eating.</p>
