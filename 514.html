<h1>Instructions</h1>

<div class="container2">
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>First things first, the dough! throw all the ingredients into a blender and set it to high. Once the blender grinds to a halt, you've got the perfect dough! </p>
    <p>(It'll take a while to remove the dough from the blender, and you might want to have a backup blender in case the first one breaks.)</p>
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>Knead dough into a ball, then toss it into the oven at <b>250 degrees</b> for it to rise. Wait the full hour if you can, but if you're impatient,</p>
    <p>turning the temperature up will decrease the time it takes to rise. (every 10 degrees = 10 minutes you don't have to wait!)</p>
    <p><i>For extra credit: put the dough in a bowl first.</i></p>
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>Once the dough has risen, take it out of the oven and roll it out as much as you can. Get a nice spread, really work those forearms!</p>

    <h2>Step 4</h2>
    <p>Mix the cinnamon filling, and spread over the dough. Then, roll up the dough tightly and cut into rolls. Turn oven to <b>460 degrees</b> and set a timer for <b>20 minutes</b> (10 minutes at 500 works too). </p>
    <h2>Step 5</h2>
    <p>Time to work on the frosting! Knead ingredients thoroughly by hand until combined. If you don't have any mayonnaise, cream cheese works well as a substitute.</p>
    <h2>Step 6</h2>
    <p>Keep your nose tuned to the oven, as a smoky smell might emanate after a few minutes. Once that happens, or when the timer goes off, remove the rolls,</p>
    <p>apply the frosting, and you're done! Let the rolls cool for a few minutes before eating.</p>
