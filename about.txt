Hi! 
My name is Andrew, 
and I'm making a career switch to (hopefully) software/web development.

I've been self-teaching for a while, mainly learning python to create some projects for work.
I'm excited to learn new languages (especially javascript!) and finally be able to host code on an interactive webpage.
